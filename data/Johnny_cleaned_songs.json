Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, my daddy left home when I was three\nAnd he didn't leave much to ma and me\nJust this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze\nNow, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid\nBut the meanest thing that he ever did\nWas before he left, he went and named me \"Sue\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, he must've thought that it was quite a joke\nAnd it got a lot of laughs from a lots of folks\nIt seems I had to fight my whole life through\nSome gal would giggle and I'd get red\nAnd some guy'd laugh then I'd bust his head\nI tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named \"Sue\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I grew up quick and I grew up mean\nMy fists got hard and my wits got keen\nRoamed from town to town to hide my shame\nBut I made me a vow to the Moon and stars\nI'd search the honky-tonks and bars\nAnd kill the man who gave me that awful name\n[Verse 4]\nWell, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July\nAnd I just hit town and my throat was dry\nI thought I'd stop and have myself a brew\nAt an old saloon on a street of mud\nThere at a table, dealing stud\nSat the dirty, mangy dog that named me \"Sue\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nWell, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad\nFrom a worn-out picture that my mother'd had\nAnd I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye\nHe was big and bent and gray and old\nAnd I looked at him and my blood ran cold\nAnd I said, \"My name is Sue! How do you do?\nNow you gonna die!\"\nYeah, that's what I told him!\n\n[Verse 6]\nWell, I hit him hard right between the eyes\nAnd he went down, but to my surprise\nHe come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear\nBut I busted a chair right across his teeth\nAnd we crashed through the wall and into the street\nKicking and a-gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer\n[Verse 7]\nI tell you, I've fought tougher men\nBut I really can't remember when\nHe kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile\nI heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss\nAnd he went for his gun and I pulled mine first\nHe stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile\n\n[Verse 8]\nAnd he said, \"Son, this world is rough\nAnd if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough\nAnd I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along\nSo I give you that name and I said goodbye\nI knew you'd have to get tough or die\nAnd it's that name that helped to make you strong\"\nYeah\n\n[Verse 9]\nHe said, \"Now you just fought one hell of a fight\nAnd I know you hate me and you got the right\nTo kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do\nBut you ought to thank me, before I die\nFor the gravel in your guts and the spit in your eye\nBecause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue\"\n\nYeah, but what could I do?\nWhat could I do?\n[Verse 10]\nI got all choked up and I threw down my gun\nAnd I called him my pa, and he called me a son\nAnd I came away with a different point of view\nAnd I think about him, now and then\nEvery time I try and every time I win\nAnd if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him\nBill or George! Any damn thing but Sue! I still hate that name!"

He had his band together- I don't remember, really, anybody in the band except Chuck Cocklin because, uh, the spotlight was only on Jack and Chuck and, uh, Chuck would often take the break or take the song over from Jack when maybe he'd sometimes forget the words or forget the arrangement or something. Not that he was in a forgetful mood, but it was just one of those nights, you know? It was kind of a nervous premier performance, like an opening night at the Exit/In. And he kept saying to Chuck, \"I don't like that. Let's do something fast.\" So all night long, he didn't really do something fast, but Jack Clement kept saying, \"I wanna hear a fast song.\" So us songwriters, sometimes we do things in secret. That night, when I went home, three or four years ago, I wrote a song called \"A Fast Song\" for Jack Clement and it's never been recorded\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, the only thing that'll move me now is a fast song\nSung long and barreling on\nAnd I don't wanna hear no crying all-gone-wrong song\nKick it off and let's all pick a fast song\nNow, don't go bringing singing, strumming me no slow tune\nStay away from all that moon and \"June Spoon Croon\" tune\nThrow me one that's flying and I'll hang on\nI'll come in on my part on a fast song\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, it don't have to have a banjo or mandolin\nBut let it in if it wants in\nKeep the rosin handed and the horse there tough and tight\nPick it up and I'm liable to pick all night\nAh, but don't go bringing singing, strumming me no slow tune\nStay away from all that moon and \"Spoon June Croon\" tune\nThrow me one that's flying and I'll hang on\nI'll come in on my part on a fast song\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, don't go bringing singing, strumming me no slow tune\nStay away from all that moon and \"Spoon June Croon\" tune\nThrow me one that's flying and I'll hang on\nI'll come in on my part on a fast song"

There ain't nothing wrong with me!\"\nAnd then they give me my injection and I go right back to sleep\nAnd my days are kind of foggy and my nights are dreamy too\nFor they're taking good care of me while committed to Parkview"

I can see me when I was 17 years old standing in the end of the Dyess High School gymnasium at the senior class graduation. I was a junior at the time. The next year, I graduated. But I was a junior and they called on me to sing a \"special\", they called it, for the graduation, for the commencement exercises, so... I'm sorry, but I don't remember my piano player's name. It was a schoolteacher. She played the piano and I sang this song. This was- I guess this was when I was looking for myself. But I never forgot that because it was one of my first public singing occasions. And I've sung this song, mainly, to myself ever since I was 17 years old because of those memories. I suppose this song is Elizabethan. The words sound like the King James version of the Bible\n\n[Chorus]\nDrink to me only with thine eyes\nAnd I will pledge with mine\nOr leave a kiss within the cup\nAnd I'll not ask for wine\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise\nDoth ask a drink divine\nBut might I of Jove's nectar sip\nI would not change for thine\n\n[Verse]\nI sent thee late a rosy wreath\nNot so much honoring thee\nAs giving it a hope that there\nIt could not withered be\nBut thou thereon didst only breathe\nAnd sentst it back to me\nSince when it grows and smells, I swear\nNot of itself, but thee\n\n[Chorus]\nDrink to me only with thine eyes\nAnd I will pledge with mine\nOr leave a kiss within the cup\nAnd I'll not ask for wine\nThe thirst that from the soul doth rise\nDoth ask a drink divine\nBut might I of Jove's nectar sip\nI would not change for thine"

You can answer when you can\n\"No I bought this candy for your Ma or Pa, or for John the hired hand\n\"I just thought you'd like to see it. Now I'm gonna take it away\"\nNow wasn't that a foolish question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day\n\nAnd then most every morning, there is someone 'round the place\nWho sees you take the shaving brush and lather up your face\nAnd as you give the razor a preliminary wave\nThis fool will walk up and ask you, \"Are you gonna take a shave?\"\n\nFoolish questions! Your answer is, I hope\n\"No! I ain't prepared for shavin', I just like the taste of soap!\nI kinda like to take the shaving brush and paint myself this way\"\nNow wasn't that a foolish question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!\n\nNow then there's this fella who meets you on your way\nAnd asks you why your all dressed up and listens while you say\nThat you just been returning from the funeral of poor old Uncle Ned\nAs soon as you have told him, he will say, \"Is Ned dead?\"\n\nFoolish questions! You might as well reply\n\"No, he thought he'd have the funeral now. Then later on he'd die\nYou know Ned was always so original, he wanted it that way\"\nNow wasn't that a Foolish Question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!\nNow suppose the elevator guy should forget to close the door\nAnd you should tumble down, oh say forty-seven floors\nAnd when you reach the bottom and you're lying there inert\nSome fool will stick his head down the shaft and holler, \"Are you hurt?\"\n\nFoolish Questions! Your dying words are\n\"No! I was in an awful hurry and that elevator's just too slow\nUsually saves a lot of time, you know, comin' down this way\"\nNow wasn't that a Foolish Question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!\n\nThat was a Foolish Question! You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!"

America is mine!\nStop that independence talk before it gets around\nOr it's gonna be hard to hold them rebels down\"\nWell, the King was talking about the men like Paul Revere\nAnd the minutemen who held their dream of independence dear\nThey kept their eyes on the British, they watched them day and night\nThey knew very soon they'd get their chance to stand and fight\nYes, they knew that the British would be moving any hour\nSo they arranged a signal in the North End church tower\nPaul was watching when the tower showed a light\nAnd he started on his midnight ride\nHe jumped on his horse, hooves started a-humming\nHe screamed out his warning, \"Redcoats are coming!\nBetter get your guns and your fighting britches on\nThey're coming and they're eight hundred strong\"\nNext morning at Concord and Lexington town\nThe spirit of freedom turned the redcoats around\nWhen we praise the men who made this mighty nation we have here\nThen let's remember Paul Revere\nYes, let's remember Paul Revere\n[Outro]\nI guarantee you something and I want to tell you all\nThat we never would've been here if it hadn't have been for Paul\nYes, sir, I surely doubt us ever being here\nIf it hadn't have been for that man on that horse named Mr. Revere"

Damn\nNo tellin' what you'd do if you pull an apple or something\nWell, I'd like to do this song on behalf of all you guys here at San Quentin to kind of get back at whoever you want to out there\nIn my case, I'd like to get back at the fella down in Starkville, Mississippi that still has my thirty-six dollars\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, I left my motel room down at the Starkville Motel\nThe town had gone to sleep and I was feelin' fairly well\nI strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees\nI was whistlin', pickin' flowers, swayin' in the southern breeze\nI found myself surrounded, one policeman said, \"That's him\nCome along, wild flower child, don't you know that it's 2 AM?\"\nThey're bound to get you 'cause they got a curfew\nAnd you go to the Starkville City Jail\n[Verse 2]\nWell, they threw me in the car and started driving into town\nI said, \"What the hell did I do?\" and he said, \"Shut up and sit down\"\nWell, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks\nI said, \"Wait, my name is,\" \"Aw, shut up,\" well, I sure was in a fix\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night\nI said, \"Come back here, you so-and-so, I ain't bein' treated right\nWell, they're bound to get you 'cause they got a curfew\nAnd you go to the Starkville City Jail\n\n[Verse 4]\nI started pacing back and forth, and now and then, I'd yell\nAnd kick my forty-dollar shoes against the steel door of my cell\nI'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night, nobody came\nThen I sadly remembered they didn't even take my name\n\n[Verse 5]\nAt 8 AM, they let me out, I said, \"Give me them things of mine\"\nThey gave me a sneer and a guitar pick and a yellow dandelion\nThey're bound to get you 'cause they got a curfew\nAnd you go to the Starkville City Jail\nAnd you go to the Starkville City Jail"

Through the parka's fold, it stabbed like a driven nail\nIf our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze 'til sometimes we couldn't see\nIt wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee\n\nAnd that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow\nAnd the dogs were fed, and the stars overhead were dancing heel and toe\nHe turned to me, and \"Cap,\" says he, \"I'll cash in this trip, I guess\nAnd if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request.\"\n\nWell, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of a moan:\n\"It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold 'til I'm chilled clean through to the bone\nYet it ain't being dead - it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains\nSo I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains.\"\nWell, a pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail\nAnd we started on at the break of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale\nAnd he crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee\nAnd before nightfall, a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee\n\nWith a corpse half-hid that I couldn't get rid, I hurried, horror-driven\nThere wasn't a breath in that land of death and because of a promise given\nIt was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say, \"You may tax your brawn and brains\nBut you promised true and it's up to you to cremate my last remains.\"\n\nNow a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code\nIn the days to come, though my lips were numb, in my heart, how I cursed that load\nIn the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, 'round in a ring\nHowled out their woes to the homeless snows - O God! how I loathed that thing\n\nAnd every day, that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow\nAnd on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low\nAnd the trail was bad, and I felt half-mad, but I swore I would not give in\nAnd I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin\n\n'til I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;\nIt was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a thrice it was called the \"Alice May.\"\nAnd I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum\nThen, \"Here,\" said I, with a sudden cry, \"is my crematorium.\"\n\nSome planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire\nSome coal I found that was lying 'round, and I heaped the fuel higher\nWell, the flames just soared and the furnace roared - such a blaze you never did see\nAnd I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee\nThen I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so\nAnd the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow\nIt was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why\nAnd the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky\n\nI do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear\nBut the stars came out and they danced about before I ventured near\nI was sick with dread, but I bravely said, \"I'll just take a peek inside\nI guess he's cooked and it's time I looked,\" then the door I opened wide\n\nAnd there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar\nAnd he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said, \"Please close that door\nIt's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm\nAnd since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, this is the first time I've been warm.\"\n\nThere are strange things done in the midnight sun\nBy the men that toil for gold\nThe Arctic trails have their secret tales\nThat would make your blood run cold\nThe Northern Lights have seen queer sights\nBut the queerest they ever did see\nWas that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge\nThat I cremated Sam McGee"

        "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWhen I was about 14 years old, I was a water boy on the river crew. The Tyronza River ran right through Mississippi County, Arkansas, where I lived. And I got a job for three dollars a day carrying water to all the workmen that were cleaning out the river, the dredging crew. And they say there was a cottonmouth moccasin every square yard on the banks of that Tyronza River. I saw some mighty big ones. But the thing that stuck with me about that job on that river crew was that every day at one o'clock, no matter where I was, no matter if I was supposed to have been giving water to the workmen or where I was supposed to be, I was hiding up in one of the workmen's cars, listening to the radio in the car because coming from the Memphis radio station was a group called the Lonesome Valley Trio. That was Smilin' Eddie Hill and Ira and Charlie, the Louvin Brothers. Singing those gospel songs, how I loved 'em. Years later, I finally got to meet Ira and Charlie, even worked with 'em, Eddie Hill. And some great talent, some great songs came out of the minds of all three of those people. One of the best songs, I think, the Louvin Brothers ever wrote was \"When I Stop Dreaming\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe worst that I've ever been hurt in my life\nThe first time I ever have wanted to die\nWas the night when you told me you loved someone else\nAnd you asked me if I could forget\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I stop dreaming\nThat's when I'll stop loving you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou may teach a flower to bloom in the snow\nYou may take a pebble and teach it to grow\nYou may teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds\nBut you can't teach my heart to forget\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I stop dreaming\nThat's when I'll stop loving you"
